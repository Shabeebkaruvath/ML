# 📊 Classification Report – Explanation

This output shows the **performance of two models**:

* **Decision Tree**
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

The task is **binary classification**:

* `0` → No heart disease
* `1` → Heart disease

---

## 🔹 Column meanings (VERY IMPORTANT)

### **1. Precision**

> Out of all predictions of a class, how many were correct?

**Formula:**

```
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
```

High precision → **Few false positives**

---

### **2. Recall**

> Out of all actual samples of a class, how many were correctly identified?

**Formula:**

```
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
```

High recall → **Few false negatives**

---

### **3. F1-score**

> Balance between precision and recall

**Formula:**

```
F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

Used when both precision and recall are important.

---

### **4. Support**

> Number of actual samples of that class in the test set

---

# ✅ Decision Tree Output Explanation

```
0 → 102 samples
1 → 103 samples
Total → 205 samples
```

### Class 0 (No Disease)

```
Precision = 0.97 → 97% predictions of class 0 are correct
Recall    = 1.00 → All actual class 0 cases are detected
F1-score  = 0.99 → Excellent balance
```

### Class 1 (Disease)

```
Precision = 1.00 → Every predicted disease case is correct
Recall    = 0.97 → Missed only 3% of actual disease cases
F1-score  = 0.99 → Excellent performance
```

### Accuracy

```
Accuracy = 0.99 → 99% of total predictions are correct
```

### Macro Average

* Simple average of both classes
* Treats both classes equally

### Weighted Average

* Average based on number of samples
* Useful when data is imbalanced

✅ **Conclusion (Decision Tree)**

> Decision Tree performs **extremely well** and is highly reliable.

# ⚠️ SVM Output Explanation

### Class 0 (No Disease)

```
Precision = 0.90 → 90% predictions are correct
Recall    = 0.71 → Missed many class 0 cases
F1-score  = 0.79 → Moderate performance
```

### Class 1 (Disease)

```
Precision = 0.76 → More false positives
Recall    = 0.92 → Detects most disease cases
F1-score  = 0.83 → Better recall than precision
```

### Accuracy

```
Accuracy = 0.81 → 81% correct predictions
```
